# To do
- AccountSettings.jsx: Create this page to allow the user to update display name and color settings!
- Planner.jsx: Create a feature for overdue unchecked tasks to create a notification in app. The user can clear out the task manually, check it off, or edit the task which will remove the overdue message.
- Add a feature to print the planner.
- PlannerSettings.jsx: Styles and Responsiveness
- Week.jsx: Mobile Responsiveness.


- FIX: Planner not found message when loading a new page (between Week, PlannerCalendar, and PlannerSettings)
