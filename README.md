# To do
- AccountSettings.jsx: Create this page to allow the user to update display name, color settings, and password.
- Change all CSS colors to root variables. When a new user creates an account, establish default color scheme.
- Planner.jsx: Create a feature for overdue unchecked tasks to create a notification in app. The user can clear out the task manually, check it off, or edit the task which will remove the overdue message.
- Add a feature to print the planner.
- Hamburger Menu needs an X to close menu.

- FIX: Planner not found message when loading a new page (between Week, PlannerCalendar, and PlannerSettings)
- FIX: Menus aren't completely covering other elements.
- FIX: Day selection for EditClass or AddClass in PlannerSettings are affecting each other.
