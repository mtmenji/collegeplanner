# To do
- AccountSettings.jsx: Create this page to allow the user to update display name and color settings!
- Planner.jsx: Create a feature for overdue unchecked tasks to create a notification in app. The user can clear out the task manually, check it off, or edit the task which will remove the overdue message.
- Add a feature to print the planner.
- PlannerSettings.jsx: Styles and Responsiveness
- Week.jsx: Mobile Responsiveness.


- FIX: Planner not found message when loading a new page (between Week, PlannerCalendar, and PlannerSettings)

- If no login, redirect to Login Page. If yes login, redirect to last url route.
- Where should I direct user with no planners?
- If they aren't in a specific planner and there's no week tabs, where do I show the Settings tab?
- If user has no last route, then redirect to create a planner page. But what if user deletes their last planner?
