# To do
- Calendar.jsx: Create this module. Include a weekly view (days on top, time on the left in 15m intervals) that show the class blocks but also allows the user to enter in events (these events could have reminders to send email or text reminders and also send notifications to the user on the app)
- Account Settings: Create this page to allow the user to update display name and color settings!
- Planner.jsx: Create a feature for overdue unchecked tasks to create a notification in app and push the task to the next day with an 'Overdue by X days' message. The user can clear out the task manually, check it off, or edit the task which will remove the overdue message.
- Add a feature to print the planner.
