# To do
- Calendar.jsx: Create this module. Include a weekly view (days on top, time on the left in 15m intervals) that show the class blocks but also allows the user to enter in events (these events could have reminders to send email or text reminders and also send notifications to the user on the app)
- Week.jsx: Add a 'planner settings' tab as the last tab that allows the user to edit class details or delete classes and select which days to show on the week tabs and/or calendar tab.
- Account Settings: Create this page to allow the user to update display name and color settings!
- Planner.jsx: Create the grid for the weekly tabs to match my Google Sheets doc.
- Planner.jsx: Implement task creation for within the planner. Make it match Google Sheets to where a user can click on a line to add a task and a checkbox to cross it out.
- Planner.jsx: Create a feature for overdue unchecked tasks to create a notification in app and push the task to the next day with an 'Overdue by X days' message. The user can clear out the task manually, check it off, or edit the task which will remove the overdue message.
